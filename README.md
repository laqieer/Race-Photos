## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone with Submodule

The download scripts are stored in a private submodule. Clone with:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/laqieer/Race-Photos.git

# Or if already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> **Note:** The `scripts/` submodule points to a private repo ([Race-Photos-Scripts](https://github.com/laqieer/Race-Photos-Scripts)). You need access to clone it. The gallery itself works without the submodule — only the download/management scripts require it.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Photos & Generate Manifest

See the [scripts README](https://github.com/laqieer/Race-Photos-Scripts/blob/main/README.md) for detailed usage of each download script.

```bash
# Download photos (see scripts README for platform-specific commands)
python scripts/download_<platform>.py [options]

# Update gallery
python scripts/generate_manifest.py
```

### 4. View Gallery

Start a local development server (with cache disabled) and open in browser:

```bash
python serve.py
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080, or enable GitHub Pages to view online.

## 🌐 GitHub Pages

The site is deployed automatically via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`). It also runs tests with coverage and publishes a test report artifact.

Your gallery is available at: `https://<username>.github.io/Race-Photos/`

## 🎨 Gallery Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Organized by Races**: Photos grouped by race events, sorted by date
- **Multiple Sources**: Support for photos from different race photo platforms
- **Interactive Map**: Overview map with clustered race markers and highlighted city boundaries, detail map with GPX route and photo markers
- **GPX Route Display**: Race route with km distance markers and photo positions along the route
- **Performance Chart**: Elevation, pace, and heart rate chart from GPX data
- **Photo Grouping**: Photos grouped by time proximity with pace/HR metrics
- **Strava Integration**: Link to Strava activity and GPX download on race detail pages
- **External Links**: Quick access to race results and certificates from overview page
- **Lightbox View**: Click any photo or video to view full size
- **Video Support**: Videos displayed with play icon overlay, hover-to-preview, and full playback in lightbox
- **Lazy Loading**: Photos load as you scroll for better performance

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test                    # Run unit tests
npm run test:report         # Run unit tests with coverage report
npx playwright test         # Run E2E tests against live site
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081 npx playwright test  # Run E2E tests locally
```

Unit tests use Jest with jsdom. E2E tests use Playwright against the deployed GitHub Pages site. Test reports are uploaded as CI artifacts on every push.

## 🤖 Built with GitHub Copilot
